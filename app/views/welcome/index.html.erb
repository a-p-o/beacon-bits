    <h3>Inspiration</h3>

    <p>
      One of our school's I.T. administrators discussed how they have no way in knowing how a student truly experiences
      the
      internet on campus.
    </p>

    <h3>What it does</h3>
    <p>
      Beacon Bits allows the admin to place Arduinos or Raspberry Pi anywhere on campus and gives them a visual of where
      on campus the internet works, is sub par, or disconnected.
      Beacon Bits is scalable to where any home user could place one around their house, be used in every Starbucks, or
      placed in every department store in a mall.
      Anywhere there is WiFi.
    </p>

    <h3>How we built it</h3>
    <p>
      Using Amazon Web Services, we used an Arduino running node.js to do ping and pull requests to determine the
      internet
      speed, then pushed the information up to the cloud where the information is displayed on a web interface.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>
    <p>
      A lot of hardware was incompatible with to connect to the internet or running the code needed.
    </p>

    <h3>What is next for Beacon Bits?</h3>
    <p>
      Adding graphical representations, allowing the admin to change what sites are checked for downloads.
